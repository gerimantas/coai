## üìã **PLAN OVERVIEW**

### **Development Philosophy: Legacy-Aware Migration**
This Development Plan V3.2 is specifically designed for the existing COAI legacy codebase with COAIOrchestrator. Based on comprehensive code analysis showing 90% architecture gap, this version prioritizes gradual transformation while preserving all existing functionality and ensuring zero-downtime migration.

### **Core Strategy: Parallel Development & Gradual Migration**
V3.2 explicitly addresses the critical disconnect between legacy COAIOrchestrator and modern vision:
- **Legacy System Preservation** - Maintain existing `COAIOrchestrator` and `ai_agents_full.py`
- **Parallel Architecture Development** - Build modern system in `backend/modern/`
- **API Compatibility Layer** - Ensure UI continues working during entire migration
- **Gradual Feature Migration** - Step-by-step capability transfer with rollback options

### **Key Legacy Integration Points**
- **Existing UI Structure**: 95% frontend preserved (navigation, pages, components)
- **Current API Endpoints**: Full compatibility maintained during migration
- **Database Models**: Gradual enhancement without breaking changes
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Extended to cover both legacy and modern systems

### **Critical Path Optimization**
