# Python Flask Backend Template

This template provides a modular, extensible backend foundation for any project. It is designed for easy integration with any UI (web, desktop, mobile) and can be used as a standalone API or a microservice.

## Features
- Modular Flask app with `create_app()` factory
- REST API structure (easy to extend)
- Example endpoints: status, hello, (placeholders for commands, server, git actions)
- Clear file structure for routes, utilities, and future modules
- Ready for Docker, testing, and CI/CD integration
